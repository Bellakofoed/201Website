		<h2>NETWORKS IN WELLINGTON</h2>
		<h3>Wellinton may be small, but as a city, we are all very connected in our own quirky ways. Aspects on the streets of Wellington remind us everyday of the underground networking, and hidden infrustructure of cords and cables that lie beneath the cities streets. As a looped community, as well as online, Wellington has a lot of networking all around and upside down, that is very understated. If you just look around, you will most likely find an element linking to the networks of the internet. </h3>

		<h1>TRAFFIC LIGHTS</h1>
			<p>KEEPING PEDESTRAINS AND PEOPLE IN CARS SAFE, TRAFFIC LIGHTS ARE GUIDED BY A TIME LOOP INFRASTRUCTURE, TO MAKE SURE THE RIGHT LIGHTS GO OFF AT THE RIGHT TIME. SIMILAR TO THE NETWORKING ONLINE, TRAFFIC LIGHT PLACEMENTS, AND THE COLOURS RED, ORANGE, GREEN, ARE ALL COMMON IN NETWORKING. THEIR DESIGNS INDICATE DIFFERENT PATHS ON THE ROAD NETWORKS WITHIN WELLINGTON. HERE ARE SOME EXMAPLES OF SOME TRAFFIC LIGHTS REPRESENTING WELLINGTON'S INSFRUSTRUCTURE. </p>

			<div class="g-70 padded">
				<h4>VIVIAN STREET</h4>
				<p>AS A VERY POPULAR MAIN STREET IN WELLINGTON, THIS TRAFFIC LIGHT INDICATES TO GO FORTH. IT IS A ONE WAY STREET, WHICH CAN REPRESENT NETWORKING ONLINE, AS THERE IS ALWAYS A MAIN CORE CABLE NETWORKING TO THE OTHER SMALLER CABLES - JUST LIKE VIVIAN IS TOO OTHER SMALLER STREETS LIKE MARION AND DUNLOP. </p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="g-row">
			<div class="g-30">
				<img src="img/1.3.jpg">
			</div>
			<div class="g-70 padded">
				<h4>GHUZNEE STREET</h4>
				<p>THIS LIGHT HAS A 3 WAY CONNECTING INFRUSTRUCTURE, WHICH REPRESENTS NETWORKING IN A WAY OF TOGETHERNESS. THE NETWORK BENEATH THE ROAD WOULD HAVE TO TAKE THIS INTO CONSIDERATION WHEN JOINING THE CITY INTO ONE BIG LOOPED NETWORK. THE INFLUX OF PARKED CARS IN COMPARRISON TO THE MOVING CARS, ALSO REPRESENTS DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE NETWORK WORKING IN FASTER AND SLOWER LOOPS. </p>

			<div class="g-70 padded">
				<h4>CUBA STREET</h4>
				<p>AT THE TOP OF CUBA YOU ARE ALLOWED TO DRIVE STRAIGHT DOWN, HOWEVER WHEN YOU GET TO THE CONNECTING GHUZNEE STREET, THE ROAD DISCONTINUES INTO A WALKWAY. JUST LIKE NETWORKING, WHEN THERE ARE ASPECTS BLOCKING ELEMENTS WITHIN THE NETWORK, OR A PART OF THE NETWORK HAS A VERY SPECIFIC PURPOSE. JUST AS THESE LIGHTS DO AT THE TOP TO CUBA, TO HELP CONNECT THE ROAD INFRUSTRUCTURE ALL AROUND THE CITY. </p>

	<section id="two">
		<h1>TICKET MACHINE</h1>
			<p>TICKET MACHINES HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A CRUCIAL PART OF WELLINGTONS CITY INFRUSTRUCTURE DUE TO THE LACK OF PARKING IN THE CITY (COMPARED TO THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE WANTING TO PARK). TICKET MACHINES REPRESENT DIFFERENT ASPECTS MORE CRUCIAL THEN OTHERS WITHIN NETWORKING. AS THE SPEED MAY BE SLOWER IN POPULAR PARTS THEN LESS USED PARTS WITHIN ONLINE NETWORKS, JUST AS THERE WOULD BE A LACK OF CARS IN THE CBD OF WELLINGON. TICKET MACHINES HAVE NOW ALSO EVOLVED INTO TXT-A-TICKET, THE CONCEPT WORKS AROUND THE NETWORKS OF THE INTERNET TO WORK.</p>

				<h4>VIVIAN STREET</h4>
				<p>BUSY ONE WAY STREET WHICH ONLY HAS HOUR OR TEN MINUTE PARKING SPOTS, WHICH SHOW IT IS A VERY POPULAR PLACE ON THE ROAD NETWORKS OF WELLINGTON</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="g-row">
			<div class="g-30">
				<img src="img/2.2.jpg">
			</div>
			<div class="g-70 padded">
				<h4>TORY STREET</h4>
				<p>JUST LIKE VIVIAN, TORY IS A CRUCIAL STREET IN WELLINGTON, WITH A FEW SHOPPING CENTRES, BUSINESSES, RESTRUANTS AND BARS ALIKE. DUE TO TORY BEING QUITE A SMALL ROAD PARKING IS ALWAYS VERY EXPENSIVE AND TICKETS IN THE TICKET MACHINE WILL BE MORE THEN OTHER QUIETER PLACES (ALIKE TO THE INTERNET'S MORE POPULAR PLACES BEING MORE EXPENSIVE).</p>

			<div class="g-70 padded">
				<h4>HAINING STREET</h4>
				<p>HAINING STREET IS A SMALL ONE WAY STREET THAT CONNECTS TWO VERY MAIN STREETS IN WELLINGTON. OFTEN PEOPLE WONT USE THE TICKET MACHINE, AS THEY ARE QUICKLY RUNING INTO TO ONE OF THE INDUSTRIAL PLACES ON THE ROAD AND WONT GET A TICKET, AND THEY BELIEVE THEY WONT BE PARKED FOR LONG. JUST LIKE USING A SMALLER NETWORK THINKING IT'LL BE FAST AND CHEAP, HOWEVER THIS MAY NOT BE THE CASE</p>

	<section id="three">
		<h1>MANHOLE COVERS</h1>
			<p>MANHOLE COVERS ARE LIKE PORTALS TO THE UNDERGROUND NETWORKS AND INFRUSTRUCTURES LYING BENEATH. DIFFERENT MANHOLES REPRESENT SPECIFIC AREAS WITHIN A HUGE NETWORK, AND HELPS CREATE IDENTITIES FOR DIFFERENT ASPECTS WITHIN THE NETWORK.</p>

			<div class="g-70 padded">
				<h4>DANGER ELECTRICITY</h4>
				<p>THESE PARTICULAR MANHOLES ARE INCREDIBLY INPORTANT FOR THE CITIES NETWORKING AS IT FOCUSES ON WHAT NETWORKING ONLINE NEEDS TO SERVICE, AND THAT IS ELECTRICITY. THEREFORE THIS REPRESENTS NETWORKING CONTINUING.</p>
			</div>

		<div class="g-row">
			<div class="g-30">
				<img src="img/3.2.jpg">

			<div class="g-70 padded">
				<h4>COMPANY NAME</h4>
				<p>JUST LIKE ONLINE NETWORKING, THERE IS ALSO BUSINESS NETWORKING, WHERE DIFFERENT BUSINESSES ARE CONNECTED IN THE NETWORKS MORE THEN OTHERS. DIFFERENT POWER, INTERNET, ROAD COMPANIES HELP CONTINUE THE FLOW OF THE NETWORK AROUND WELLINGTON.</p>

		<div class="g-row">
			<div class="g-30">
				<img src="img/3.3.jpg">
			</div>
			<div class="g-70 padded">
				<h4>BLANK</h4>
				<p>THIS BLANK MANHOLE JUST REPRESENTS A PORTAL TO THE UNDERGROUND NETWORKS BELOW, AND HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO SEE WITHIN THE NETWORK, TO UNDERSTAND THE INFRUSTRUCTURE.</p>
